# Data-Science-Lab

Together with my colleagues **Lorenzo Bruni** and **Diego Bartoli Geijo**, we are conducting a market analysis in order to divide users into homogeneous groups of consumers. Through a selection of features and users, we are managing the data in order to apply clustering techniques in order to group customers into a low and discrete number of clusters.

The language used is **Python**.

[This project will be complete by October]
