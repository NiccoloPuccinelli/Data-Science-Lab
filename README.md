# Data Science Lab

Together with my colleagues **Lorenzo Bruni** and **Diego Bartoli Geijo**, we are conducting a market analysis in order to divide users into homogeneous groups of consumers. Through a selection of features and users, we are managing the data with the aim of applying clustering techniques and group millions of customers into a low and discrete number of clusters.

The language used is **Python**.
